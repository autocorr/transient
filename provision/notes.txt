ultimately this should be set up as a group of version controlled modules with
something like chef or puppet so that the user could select which things they
want to install, or swap-out by git-cloning from their own repositories in the
case of customized pieces of software like editors or shells.

some of the packages could take a long time to build, so perhaps a pre-install
ncurses type of menu or scipt would be optimal

in near term, use a python configuration script and short module to execute
bash scripts, then migrate to puppet or chef when things get complicated.
